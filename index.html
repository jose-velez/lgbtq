                <p>
                    I’m going to point out something from an academic resource to show the difference between
                    hermaphrodite and intersex.

                </p>
                <p>“In biology, “hermaphrodite” means an organism that has both “male” and “female” sets of reproductive
                    organs (like snails).
                    In humans, there are no “hermaphrodites” in this sense, although doctors have called people with
                    intersex conditions “hermaphrodites.”
                    We find the word “hermaphrodite” misleading, mythologizing, and stigmatizing. Although some intersex
                    activists do reclaim and use this term to describe themselves,
                    it is not an appropriate term to refer to intersex people in general. In short, snails are the
                    hermaphrodites; humans are not. Also, please avoid using the word “intersexual”
                    as a noun; we prefer “intersex people” or “people with intersex conditions/experiences” (Intersex
                    Initiative). </p>

                <p>There are a few more terminologies to keep in mind. According to Asexuality 101:</p>
                <ul class="list-group" style="margin-bottom: 4%;">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Aromantic – people who experience little or no romantic attraction and
                        are content with close friendships and other non-romantic relationships.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Demisexual – people who only experience sexual attraction once they form
                        a strong emotional connection with the person.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Grey-A – people who identify somewhere between sexual and asexual on the
                        sexuality spectrum.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Queerplatonic – One type of non-romantic relationship where there is an
                        intense emotional connection going beyond what is traditionally thought of as friendship.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Romantic orientations – Aces commonly use hetero-, homo-, bi-, and pan-
                        in front of the word romantic to describe who they experience romantic attraction to.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have not seen some of these terms before, now is a great opportunity to familiarize yourself
                    and try to remember them!
                    Like I said before, in order to support the LGBT+ community we must be informed before we start
                    sharing information.
                    However, this information was not shared with the sole purpose for you just to become an ally, this
                    information was made for you to grasp
                    concepts that might be unknown to you or maybe start to discover something about yourself that you
                    have not thought about before.
                    The LGBT+ community really needs help and allies since the amount of rejection and oppression they
                    receive is extremely high. </p>

                Like I mentioned before, the amount of oppression and rejection that these individuals face is not
                something we would like for a loved one,
                or just another human being to go through. “Greater levels of family rejection tend to be associated
                with greater levels of depression,
                substance abuse, unprotected sex, and suicide attempts in North American samples” (Tskhay).
                By being active educating other people, you could change someone’s mind and possibly help another
                individual going through a tough situation.
